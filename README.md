## Description
**A Room Too Far's server** handles all the communication between the arcade machine and the Google Cloud Datastore and also serves the game's website and level editor.

When updating a level in the level editor, you must make sure that you have linked your web account to a game account in your *Account Settings*, otherwise you cannot save your level.
